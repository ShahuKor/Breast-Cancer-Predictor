# Breast Cancer Predictor

This application predicts whether a breast mass is BENIGN or MALIGNANT based on the measurements it receives using a machine learning model.

- BENIGN means the tumour is not harmful.
- MALIGNANT means that the tumour is cancerous.
- You can also manually adjust the measurements using the 30 different parameters in the sidebar.
- It is deployed on "Streamlit Community Cloud".
- I have also used CSS to make make changes in the frontend and design aspects.
- A Radar chart is also displayed which is dynamic and changes according to the changes to the parameters in real time.
